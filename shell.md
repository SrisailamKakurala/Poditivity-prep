Sure! Here’s a consolidated list of the summary parts from each section of your comprehensive guide on shell scripting, formatted for quick reference:

---

### **📜 Introduction to Shell Scripting**
- A **shell** is a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system.
- Types of shells include **Bash**, **Zsh**, **Fish**, etc.
- **Shell vs Terminal vs Command Line**: Shell is the interpreter, Terminal is the interface, and Command Line is where commands are typed.
- Set up a shell environment by configuring the default editor and checking shell versions.

---

### **🚀 Running Shell Scripts**
- Create a shell script using `vim` and make it executable with `chmod +x`.
- Run scripts using `./script.sh` or `bash script.sh`.

---

### **🔑 Making a Script Executable**
- Use `chmod +x script.sh` to make a script executable.
- Check file permissions with `ls -l`.

---

### **👨‍💻 Writing Your First Shell Script: `Hello, World!`**
- Create a simple script that prints "Hello, World!".
- Save and run the script to see the output.

---

### **🎯 Summary**
- Shell is the command-line interface for Linux.
- Different types of shells exist (Bash, Zsh, etc.).
- A shell script is a text file containing shell commands.
- Use `chmod +x script.sh` to execute scripts.

### **📜 Variables and Data Types in Shell Scripting**
- Shell variables are created without data types and accessed with `$`.
- Environment variables are global and can be set with `export`.
- Local vs global variables: Local variables are only available in the current shell session.
- Positional parameters (`$1`, `$2`, `$@`, `$#`) are used to pass arguments to scripts.
- Special variables (`$?`, `$$`, `$!`, `$*`) provide information about the script's execution.
- Arrays can be defined and accessed using indexed and associative arrays.

---

### **📜 Input & Output in Shell Scripting**
- Used `read` for user input (normal, silent, timeout, arrays).
- Used `echo` and `printf` for formatted output.
- Understood `stdin` (0), `stdout` (1), `stderr` (2).
- Used file redirection (`>`, `>>`, `2>`, `&>`, `/dev/null`).
- Used piping (`|`) to connect commands.
- Used Here Documents (`<<EOF`) for multi-line input.

---

### **🎯 Summary**
- Used `read` for user input.
- Used `echo` and `printf` for formatted output.

- Used while loops for repeated execution based on conditions.
- Used until loops for executing until a condition is true.
- Controlled loops with `break` and `continue`.

---

### **📜 Functions in Shell Scripting**
- Defined functions to encapsulate reusable code.
- Called functions by name in scripts.
- Passed arguments to functions and accessed them using `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- Returned values from functions using `return` and captured output with command substitution.
- Implemented recursive functions for tasks like calculating factorials.
