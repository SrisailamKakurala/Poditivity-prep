## 🔥 **Section 1: Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**  

### **1️⃣ Core Concepts**  

💡 **What is EC2?**  
EC2 is a **virtual server in the cloud** that allows you to run applications without buying hardware.  

💡 **Instance Types**  
- **General Purpose** – Balanced CPU, RAM (e.g., t2.micro, t3.medium)  
- **Compute Optimized** – High CPU (e.g., c5.large)  
- **Memory Optimized** – For RAM-heavy apps (e.g., r5.large)  
- **Storage Optimized** – High disk I/O (e.g., i3.large)  
- **GPU Instances** – Machine Learning, Graphics (e.g., p3.large)  

💡 **Elastic IP vs Public IP**  
- **Public IP**: Assigned dynamically. Lost on reboot.  
- **Elastic IP**: Permanent public IP, can be remapped to another instance.  

💡 **Security in EC2**  
- **Security Groups** → Firewall at the instance level (Allow/Block Ports).  
- **NACL (Network ACL)** → Firewall at the subnet level (Applied before Security Groups).  
- **IAM Roles** → Assign permissions to EC2 without storing credentials inside.  

💡 **EC2 Pricing Models**  
- **On-Demand** – Pay per second/hour, good for short-term workloads.  
- **Reserved** – 1-3 years commitment, cheaper than On-Demand.  
- **Spot** – Cheapest, but can be terminated anytime by AWS.  
- **Savings Plan** – Flexible alternative to Reserved Instances.  

💡 **Load Balancer & Auto Scaling**  
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.  
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: Automatically adds/removes instances based on demand.

### **2️⃣ Interview Questions (EC2)**  

✅ **Basic**  
1. What is EC2 and how does it work?  
2. Explain the different EC2 instance types.  
3. What is an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)?  
4. What is the difference between stopping and terminating an instance?  

✅ **Intermediate**  
5. What happens when an EC2 instance is rebooted?  
6. How does an EC2 instance communicate with the internet?  
7. How do you enable SSH access to an EC2 instance?  
8. Difference between EBS (Elastic Block Store) and Instance Store?  

✅ **Advanced**  
9. What happens if you try to attach a volume to multiple EC2 instances?  
10. How do you ensure high availability using EC2?  

---

### **3️⃣ Hands-on EC2: Node.js Example**  

#### **👉 List EC2 Instances**  
```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
AWS.config.update({ region: 'us-east-1' });

const ec2 = new AWS.EC2();
ec2.describeInstances({}, (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.log('Error', err);
  else console.log(JSON.stringify(data.Reservations, null, 2));
});
```

#### **👉 Start an EC2 Instance**
```javascript
const params = { InstanceIds: ['i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'] };
ec2.startInstances(params, (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.log('Error', err);
  else console.log('Instance Started:', data);
});
```

## 🔥 **Section 2: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**  

### **1️⃣ Core Concepts**  

💡 **What is S3?**  
S3 is an **object storage service** for storing and retrieving data over the web.  

💡 **Storage Classes**  
- **S3 Standard** – Default, high durability.  
- **S3 IA (Infrequent Access)** – Cheaper but retrieval cost applies.  
- **S3 Glacier** – Used for backups & long-term archival.  

💡 **S3 Bucket Policies vs ACLs**  
- **Bucket Policy** – JSON-based permission rules at the bucket level.  
- **ACL (Access Control List)** – Used for per-object permissions.  

💡 **Data Protection in S3**  
- **Versioning** – Keep old versions of objects.  
- **Encryption** – Server-side and client-side encryption.  
- **Pre-Signed URLs** – Temporary, secure URLs for accessing private objects.  

---

### **2️⃣ Interview Questions (S3)**  

✅ **Basic**  
1. What is S3 and how is it used?  
2. Explain S3 storage classes.  
3. What is the maximum object size in S3?  

✅ **Intermediate**  
4. How does S3 ensure data durability?  
5. What is the difference between S3 Versioning and Lifecycle Policies?  
6. How can you restrict access to an S3 bucket?  

✅ **Advanced**  
7. How does S3 Cross-Region Replication work?  
8. What is S3 Event Notification?  

---

### **3️⃣ Hands-on S3: Node.js Example**  

#### **👉 Upload File to S3**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();

const params = {
  Bucket: 'my-bucket',
  Key: 'file.txt',
  Body: fs.readFileSync('file.txt')
};

s3.upload(params, (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.log('Error:', err);
  else console.log('File uploaded:', data.Location);
});
```

#### **👉 Generate a Pre-Signed URL**
```javascript
const params = {
  Bucket: 'my-bucket',
  Key: 'file.txt',
  Expires: 60 // URL valid for 60 seconds
};

s3.getSignedUrl('getObject', params, (err, url) => {
  console.log('Download Link:', url);
});
```

## 🔥 **Section 3: AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**  

### **1️⃣ Core Concepts**  

💡 **What is IAM?**  
IAM is AWS's identity and permission system to control user and service access.  

💡 **Key Components**  
- **Users** → Individual accounts (e.g., developer, admin).  
- **Groups** → Collection of users with the same permissions.  
- **Roles** → Temporary permissions assigned to AWS services.  
- **Policies** → JSON documents defining permissions.  

💡 **IAM Best Practices**  
- **Enable MFA for root account.**  
- **Use IAM roles for EC2 instead of storing credentials.**  
- **Follow Least Privilege Principle.**

const iam = new AWS.IAM();
iam.createUser({ UserName: 'test-user' }, (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.log('Error:', err);
  else console.log('User Created:', data);
});
```
